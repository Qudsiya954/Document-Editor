### 📝 **Project Description: Real-Time Collaborative Document Editor**

The **Real-Time Collaborative Document Editor** is a web-based application that enables users to create, edit, and collaborate on text documents seamlessly—similar to platforms like Google Docs. Built using the powerful MERN stack (**MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js**) with **Tailwind CSS** for a responsive UI, this app allows multiple users to work on the same document simultaneously, with real-time synchronization and auto-save capabilities.

Users can **sign up, log in**, and **manage their personal document space**—including the ability to create, edit, and delete documents. The editor includes a set of rich formatting tools, ensuring a flexible writing experience. All changes are automatically saved to the backend, reducing the risk of data loss. The app is optimized for real-time collaboration, making it ideal for students, professionals, or teams working remotely.

This project demonstrates practical implementation of user authentication, state management, RESTful API integration, and live document editing—making it an excellent example of a full-stack application with real-world utility.
